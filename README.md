# cluster-topology-configuration

A simple way to add racks to a cluster. Compatible with [qzweng/kubernetes-scheduler-simulator](https://github.com/qzweng/kubernetes-scheduler-simulator).

## Overview

**cluster-topology-configuration** provides a straightforward method to define and configure rack topology for clusters. This project is designed to work seamlessly with the [kubernetes-scheduler-simulator](https://github.com/qzweng/kubernetes-scheduler-simulator), enabling enhanced scheduling and simulation based on topology-aware rack information.

## Features

- **Simple Configuration:** Easily specify rack and node relationships using Python.
- **Compatibility:** Integrates with [kubernetes-scheduler-simulator](https://github.com/qzweng/kubernetes-scheduler-simulator).
- **Extensible:** Designed to support future topology extensions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- [kubernetes-scheduler-simulator](https://github.com/qzweng/kubernetes-scheduler-simulator) (optional, for integration)

### Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ndr2084/cluster-topology-configuration.git
cd cluster-topology-configuration
```

Install dependencies (if any):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

Configure your cluster topology using the provided Python scripts and configuration files. See the [examples](#examples) section for guidance.

#### Example

```python
from topology import ClusterTopology

topology = ClusterTopology()
topology.add_rack('rack-1', ['node1', 'node2'])
topology.add_rack('rack-2', ['node3', 'node4'])
topology.save('topology.json')
```

### Integration

To use with [kubernetes-scheduler-simulator](https://github.com/qzweng/kubernetes-scheduler-simulator), export your topology and import it into the simulator as per its documentation.
